# Gemini CLI

A command-line interface tool for interacting with Google's Gemini AI.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g briggs-gemini-cli
```

## First-time Setup

When you run the `gemini` command for the first time, you'll be prompted to enter your Gemini API key. You can get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

```bash
gemini
```

This will start an interactive chat session with Gemini AI. You can:

- Type your questions or prompts

### Single Query Mode

You can also ask a single question:

```bash
gemini "What is the capital of France?"
```
